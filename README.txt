All parts of the Homework has been completed. 

All sorting codes (quicksort, heapsort, mergesort) and all 
methods of the quicksort codes (median of three, middle, first) are located in the "Sort.h" file. Please refer to that file
if you need to look at the code. 

In the test_qsort_algorithm.cc file, the Quicksort functions call to functions in the Sort.h file. 

The code can be compiled by using the "make all" command. 

Run the test_sorting algorithms code by using the following format: 
./test_sorting_algorithms	<input_type>	<input_size>	<comparison_type> 

Run the test_qsort_algoorithm.cc file by using the following format: 
./test_qsort_algorithm	<input_type>	<input_size>	<comparison_type>
