This is a belated upload of a class project, written in C++, in which I compared various sorting algorithms and modified them in order for a Comparator class to be used for comparisons. 
This assignment consisted of two parts: 
- Modify the sorting algotihms to account for the Comparator class, create a driver program to test the running time of the various sorting algorithms. 
- Write and test variations of the quicksort algorithm (median of three, first pivot, middle pivot) 

Please note that this project employs some code, used with the permission of the professor, from the course textbook; instances of this should be clear from the head comments in the source files.
